/*
ðŸ“Œ Characteristics of abstract:
- An abstract class canâ€™t be directly instantiated (you canâ€™t create objects from it).
- It can contain abstract methods (no body) and regular methods (with body).
- An abstract method must be implemented by subclasses.
- Helps enforce a common structure across related classes.

ðŸŽ¯ Why Use It?
- To define a blueprint for other classes.
- To achieve partial abstractionâ€”you hide some implementation but allow flexibility.
- Useful when you want to force subclasses to implement specific behavior.
