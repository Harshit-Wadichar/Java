This repository contains a `Main.java` and `Project.java` file that demonstrates core Java concepts for beginners, including:

* Printing and basic methods
* Primitive vs reference types
* Strings and immutability
* Arrays (1D & 2D) and sorting
* Casting and constants (`final`)
* Operators and `Math` utilities
* Taking input with `Scanner` (tips included)
* Conditionals, switch, and loops
* Basic exception handling (try-catch)

## Quick start

**Compile:**

```
javac Main.java
```

**Run:**

```
java Main
```

## Notes

* The code is educational and intentionally verbose — ideal for learners.
