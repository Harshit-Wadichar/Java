# üå≥ Binary Search Tree (BST)

---

## ‚ú® Introduction

A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a structured binary tree that enables efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion of values. Its core idea is simple and powerful: every node‚Äôs left subtree contains values **less than** the node, and every node‚Äôs right subtree contains values **greater than** the node. This organization makes many operations fast and intuitive.

---

## üå± What is a Binary Search Tree?

* A BST is a binary tree with an ordering property: for any node `N`:

  * All values in `N`'s left subtree are **less** than `N`'s value.
  * All values in `N`'s right subtree are **greater** than `N`'s value.
* No duplicate values are stored (typical BST definition).
* An **in-order traversal** of a BST yields the elements in **sorted order**.

**Why BSTs matter:** they provide a middle ground between simple lists and fully-balanced search trees ‚Äî giving fast average-case operations with straightforward structure and implementation.

## üîé Search in BST

**Conceptual steps for searching a value in a BST:**

1. Start at the root node.
2. Compare the search key with the current node‚Äôs value.
3. If equal ‚Üí success. If smaller ‚Üí continue with the left child. If larger ‚Üí continue with the right child.
4. Repeat until the node is found or a null pointer is reached (not found).

**Key points:**

* Search exploits the ordering property; you discard half the tree at each step.
* Average time complexity: **O(log n)** (for roughly balanced trees).
* Worst-case time complexity: **O(n)** (for degenerate, chain-like trees).

---

## üî® Build a BST (Concept)

**Building a BST** means inserting values one-by-one while preserving the BST property. The typical flow:

* If the tree is empty, the new value becomes the root.
* Otherwise, compare the new value to the current node and move left or right accordingly until you find the correct empty position to insert.

**Practical considerations when building a BST:**

* The order of insertion affects the tree shape and hence performance.
* Randomized or balanced insertion strategies (e.g., AVL, Red-Black trees) can keep performance consistently good.

## üìÅ Code for Building a BST

This project contains a ready-to-run implementation that constructs a BST from a sequence of values. The code focuses on:

* Accepting values as input (array, list, or interactive entry).
* Inserting each value while maintaining the BST property.
* Providing an interface to visualize or traverse the resulting tree.

*Usage tip:* the code exposes simple ways to add values and to print the structure for inspection.

---

## üîç Code for Search in BST

A companion implementation demonstrates how to search the BST for a target value and returns an indication of presence (or node reference, depending on your chosen interface).

* It shows how to start from the root and navigate left/right based on comparisons.
* It reports success/failure and optionally the path taken.

*Usage tip:* you can test search behavior by searching for existing and non-existing values to observe average vs. worst-case paths.

## ‚ùå Delete a Node in BST (Concept)

Deleting a node from a BST must be done carefully so the BST property remains intact. There are three conceptual cases to handle:

1. **Node is a leaf** (no children):

   * Simply remove the node.

2. **Node has one child:**

   * Replace the node with its single child so the subtree remains connected.

3. **Node has two children:**

   * Replace the node‚Äôs value with a value that preserves ordering ‚Äî commonly the **in-order successor** (smallest value in the right subtree) or the **in-order predecessor** (largest value in the left subtree).
   * Remove the successor/predecessor from its original location (which now becomes a simpler deletion case).

**Key idea:** deletion transforms the problem into simpler sub-cases so the BST property holds after the operation.

---

## üß∞ Code for Deleting a Node in BST

The provided deletion code demonstrates the standard strategies for each of the three cases above and ensures the tree remains a valid BST after removal. The implementation includes:

* Safe handling of node references and child substitutions.
* Options to use in-order successor or predecessor when replacing nodes with two children.

*Usage tip:* try deleting nodes in different positions (leaf, internal with one child, internal with two children) and verify the tree‚Äôs in-order traversal remains sorted.

---

## üìê Print in Range (Concept)

**Print in Range** is a common BST operation where you output all nodes whose values fall within a given interval `[low, high]`.

**Efficient strategy:**

* Traverse the tree while pruning branches that cannot contain valid values.

  * If current node value < `low` ‚Üí skip left subtree (all smaller).
  * If current node value > `high` ‚Üí skip right subtree (all greater).
  * Otherwise, the node is within range ‚Äî include it and explore both sides where necessary.

**Why this is fast:** pruning avoids unnecessary traversal of subtrees that are out of bounds.

---

## üßæ Code for Print in Range

A practical implementation is included which:

* Accepts `low` and `high` bounds.
* Traverses the BST and prints (or returns) all values inside the range in sorted order.

*Usage tip:* Test with ranges that are disjoint from your values, fully cover them, or partially overlap to fully exercise pruning logic.

---

## üåø Root-to-Leaf Paths (Concept)

**Root-to-Leaf Paths** are the sequences of nodes from the root down to each leaf node. Extracting all such paths is useful for:

* Enumerating complete value-chains stored by the tree.
* Computing path-based metrics (sum of path values, max path, etc.).
* Visualizing or exporting tree-shaped data in sequential form.

**Typical approach (conceptual):** perform a depth-first traversal while maintaining the current path; when you hit a leaf, record the path as one complete root-to-leaf route.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Code for Root-to-Leaf Paths

The sample code collects all root-to-leaf paths and presents them as lists (or prints them). It includes:

* Recursive traversal keeping a temporary path structure.
* Safe backtracking once an explored path is recorded.

*Usage tip:* use the recorded paths to compute aggregates like path sums or to format the paths for display.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Complexity Summary

| Operation          | Average Time | Worst Time |
| ------------------ | -----------: | ---------: |
| Search             |     O(log n) |       O(n) |
| Insert             |     O(log n) |       O(n) |
| Delete             |     O(log n) |       O(n) |
| In-order Traversal |         O(n) |       O(n) |

> Note: The logarithmic average assumes the tree stays relatively balanced. In degenerate cases (sorted input inserted without balancing), the tree becomes a chain and complexity degrades to linear.

---

## üí° Practical Tips & Best Practices

* Insert values in random order (or use balancing trees) to avoid degenerate shapes.
* Use in-order traversal to **verify** correctness ‚Äî it should produce a sorted sequence.
* When deleting nodes with two children, consistently choose successor or predecessor to simplify reasoning.
* For production-grade performance, consider self-balancing BSTs (AVL, Red-Black trees).

## üèÅ Final Notes

This README outlines the concepts and purposes behind core BST operations and accompanies a code collection that implements each behavior (building, searching, deleting, range printing, and root-to-leaf paths). It avoids step-by-step code narration and focuses on intuition, use cases, and verification tips.
