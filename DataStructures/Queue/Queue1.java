/*
ðŸ”¹ 1. Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<Integer>();

Backed by a doubly linked list.

Each element is stored in a node containing references to next & previous.

Operations:

add() â†’ O(1)

remove() â†’ O(1)

peek() â†’ O(1)

Features:

Can also be used as a List (because LinkedList implements both Queue and List).

Allows null elements.

Extra memory overhead (each node stores pointers).

Good when you need frequent insertions/removals in the middle (but not common in queues).

ðŸ”¹ 2. Queue<Integer> q = new ArrayDeque<>();

Backed by a resizable array (like ArrayList but used as a deque).

Uses a circular buffer internally.

Operations:

add() â†’ Amortized O(1)

remove() â†’ O(1)

peek() â†’ O(1)

Features:

Faster than LinkedList for queue operations (better cache locality, no node overhead).

Does not allow null elements (will throw NullPointerException).

Cannot be used as a List (only as Queue or Deque).
ðŸ”¹ Which one to use?

If you just need a Queue/Deque â†’ ArrayDeque is usually faster & preferred.

If you also need List-like operations (random access, iteration, insertion at arbitrary positions) â†’ use LinkedList.
