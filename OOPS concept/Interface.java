/*
An interface is like a contract that defines what methods a class must implementâ€”but it doesnâ€™t provide the actual code for those methods.

ðŸ“Œ Characteristics of an Interface:
- Only contains method declarations (no method bodies, unless it's a default or static method).
- All methods are implicitly public and abstract.
- Variables in an interface are public, static, and final by default.
- A class uses implements to follow the interface.
- A class can implement multiple interfaces (Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance with classes, but interfaces solve that).

ðŸŽ¯ Why Use Interfaces?
- To achieve abstraction: you define what should be done, not how.
- To support multiple inheritance in a clean way.
- To allow flexible architecture: different classes can implement the same interface differently.
